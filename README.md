# The Storm Before The Storm Website

This is the source for [thestormbeforethestorm.com](http://thestormbeforethestorm.com), a static site built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

## Getting Started

To start development:

1. Make sure you have Jekyll [installed](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
2. Run `jekyll serve`.
3. Go to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

## Assets

Styles are built with SCSS and live in `lib/css`.

## Deployment

To build the site for deployment, run `jekyll build`. The site will be placed in `_site/`. You should then be able to copy the contents of that folder onto any standard web server and be all set.
